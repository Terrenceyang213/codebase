#%% set_option:加速, accelarate,
# #pandas has support for accelerating certain types of binary numerical 
# and boolean operations using the numexpr library and the bottleneck libraries.

# These libraries are especially useful when dealing with large data sets, 
# and provide large speedups. numexpr uses smart chunking, caching, and multiple cores. 
# bottleneck is a set of specialized cython routines 
# that are especially fast when dealing with arrays that have nans.

# Here is a sample (using 100 column x 100,000 row DataFrames):
# Operation     0.11.0 (ms)     Prior Version (ms)      Ratio to Prior
# df1 > df2     13.32           125.35                  0.1063
# df1 * df2     21.71           36.63                   0.5928
# df1 + df2     22.04           36.50                   0.6039

# You are highly encouraged to install both libraries. 
# See the section Recommended Dependencies for more installation info.
# These are both enabled to be used by default, you can control this by setting the options:

pd.set_option("compute.use_bottleneck", False)
pd.set_option("compute.use_numexpr", False)
